					 	<p> 
					 	Roger Cornell is a contracted process engineer at <a href=https://www.research.ibm.com/semiconductors/>IBM Research</a>, within the <a href= "https://sunypoly.edu/">SUNY Polytechnic</a> semiconductor research consortium.
					 	Roger currently specializes in in-line Critical Dimension Microscopy (CD SEM) and Overlay metrology operations. Roger uses his 
					 	technical knowledge of process optimization and development, coupled with software-enabled analytical techniques to drive process 
					 	efficiency, precision and robustness in emerging semiconductor technology nodes. 
					 	</p>
					 	<p>
					 	Roger graduated from <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/"> Northeastern University</a> in 2015 where he studied Health Science with a focus on Biochemistry.
					 	During his time at Northeastern, Roger worked at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/"> Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a> as a research associate
					 	within the Cancer program. He worked on a developmental high-throughput RNA assay that quantified expression levels of 1000 
					 	targeted genes in various human tumor cell lines and cell states. He also spent time at the <a href="http://www.masseyeandear.org/">Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary</a> 
					 	within the Glaucoma department as an Ophthalmic Imaging Technician.
					 	</p>
					 	<p>
					 	Roger is currently pursuing an Master's Degree at <a href="https://www.marist.edu/">Marist College</a> in Computer Information Systems with a focus on analytics and management.
					 	He hopes in the future to apply these skills and knowledge towards developing next-generation computer systems within the semiconductor
					 	or pharmaceutical space.
					 	</p>
					 	<p>
					 	Roger currently resides in Albany, New York. His professional interests include software systems, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, semiconductor technologies, automation, and 
					 	data analytics. He enjoys fishing, baseball, golf, web development and reading - mainly nonfiction.
